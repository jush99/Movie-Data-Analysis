# Movie-Data-Analysis

Carried out this personal project and found the correlation between different movie features and the income generated from the movie.

From Exploratory Data Analysis found that the number of votes and budget had a higher correlation with revenue generation. 

The company's name did not affect the revenue genration as much as expected. 

Plotted the heat map to show the different features taken into consideration and how they affected the revenue generation.
